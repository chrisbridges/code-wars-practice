// This problem was asked by Facebook.

// Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.

// For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.

// You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not allowed.

// Notes:
  // you know that for every number, you can use letters for 1-9 and iterate a letter for every digit
  // since the largest possible combination would be 2 numbers combined, for every 2 numbers you could combine and then iterate as well as every possible combination
